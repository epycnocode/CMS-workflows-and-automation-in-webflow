# Tame the Content Beast: CMS Workflows & Automation in Webflow

Webflow's CMS is powerful, but managing content, triggers, and notifications can feel like wrangling a digital menagerie. Luckily, Webflow's built-in automation features and custom code injection let you tame the beast and create seamless, dynamic content experiences.

**1. CMS Workflow Superpowers:**

  - **Content scheduling:** Publish new content at specific times or set automatic expiration dates.
  - **Conditional visibility:** Show or hide content based on user data, location, or other criteria.
  - **Collection updates:** Trigger workflows and notifications based on changes in your CMS collections.

**2. Code Injection for Extra Control:**

  - **Custom triggers:** Define your own triggers beyond Webflow's built-in options, like user interactions or API responses.
  - **Automated tasks:** Send emails, update databases, or perform complex actions based on your triggers.
  - **Enhanced notifications:** Create personalized email alerts or in-app notifications for specific events.

**3. Clean Code Example:**

Let's automatically send an email notification to the author whenever a new blog post is published:

```
HTML
<wf-if for="page.published">
  <wf-api-request
    url="https://api.webflow.com/v0/collections/{your-collection-id}/items/{page.id}"
    method="GET"
    on-success="sendEmail"
  ></wf-api-request>
</wf-if>

<script>
function sendEmail(data) {
  const authorEmail = data.author.email;
  const postTitle = data.title;

  fetch("/send-email", {
    method: "POST",
    body: JSON.stringify({
      to: authorEmail,
      subject: "Your post has been published!",
      body: `Your blog post "${postTitle}" is now live on our website!`,
    }),
  })
    .then(response => console.log("Email sent!"))
    .catch(error => console.error(error));
}
</script>
```
